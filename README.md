# Self-driving-car
This project is based on the visual system of a self driving car. A self driving car basically operates using sensors and machine learning algorithms. The data captured by various sensors is fed into the computer which is used to find the direction of movement. 
In this project, I take an image of a street with lane lines. Using OpenCV, the lines are highlighted.
